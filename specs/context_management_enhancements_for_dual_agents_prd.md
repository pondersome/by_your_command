# Context Management Enhancements for Dual Agents - PRD

> **Note: This document predates the topic renaming refactoring (2025-09-14). Some topic names mentioned here have been updated in the implementation. See `topic_renaming_refactoring_prd.md` for current naming.**


**Created:** 2025-09-14  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Karim Virani  
**Scope:** Enhanced context synchronization between conversation and command agents

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines enhancements to address context divergence between dual agents (conversation and command extraction) in the by_your_command system. The core problem is that each agent maintains isolated conversation context, leading to inconsistent responses and transcriptions over time.

The proposed solution introduces agent sibling awareness with the conversation agent serving as the authoritative source for user transcriptions, while maintaining the bridge as a pure relay and ensuring agents can operate standalone.

## 2. Background - Current Prompt and Context Architecture

### 2.1 Prompt Loading and Assembly Analysis

Based on investigation of the current codebase, the prompt and context management system works as follows:

#### System Prompt Assembly
- **When Assembled**: System prompts are assembled **once per session creation**, not per turn
  - During `connect_session()` â†’ `_configure_session()` in both OpenAI and Gemini agents
  - This happens when establishing a new WebSocket connection or cycling sessions
- **Assembly Process**:
  - `PromptLoader` loads prompts.yaml at startup
  - Macros are expanded **at load time** (in `_load_prompts()`)
  - When session is created:
    - Agent gets prompt by ID or uses selection rules
    - `ContextManager.build_system_prompt()` adds conversation context if available
    - Final prompt is sent as part of session configuration

#### User Prompt Prefixes
- **Current Status**: **NOT ACTIVELY USED** in production agents
  - Defined in prompts.yaml (`user_prompt_prefixes` section)
  - Methods exist in `PromptLoader` (`get_user_prefix()`, `build_full_prompt()`)
  - Only used in test files, not in actual agent code
- **Intended Design**:
  - Would prepend context to user messages
  - Supports template variables like `{last_topic}`, `{last_command}`
  - Could be used per-turn to inject context

#### Key Implications
- System prompts are static for the entire session duration
- No per-turn prompt modification currently happens
- Macro expansion happens at load time, not runtime
- Context preservation happens through `ContextManager` appending to base prompt

### 2.2 Current Context Tracking Implementation

#### OpenAI Agents
- Uses `ContextManager` to track conversation turns
- `add_conversation_turn()` called when transcriptions are received:
  - User transcripts: line 666 in oai_realtime_agent.py
  - Assistant transcripts: line 694 in oai_realtime_agent.py
- Context injected during session creation via `build_system_prompt()`
- Context preserved across session cycles (for cost optimization)

#### Gemini Agents
- Same `ContextManager` infrastructure
- `add_conversation_turn()` in receive_coordinator.py:
  - User transcripts: line 339
  - Assistant transcripts: line 392
- Context injected identically during session creation
- **Critical difference**: Command agents skip adding assistant turns (line 391-392)

## 3. Problem Statement

### 3.1 Context Divergence

Each agent maintains its own isolated context, leading to divergence over multiple conversation turns:

1. **Turn 1**: User says "move forward"
   - Conversation agent: "I'll move forward for you"
   - Command agent: Extracts `move@forward`

2. **Turn 2**: User says "do that again"
   - Conversation agent (has context): Knows "that" = move forward
   - Command agent (different context): May not understand the reference

3. **Result**: Over time, agents have completely different conversation histories

### 3.2 Transcription Divergence

When context diverges significantly, the same audio input can be transcribed differently:
- User says: "Do that again"
- Conversation agent: Transcribes as "Do that again" (knows context)
- Command agent: Might transcribe as "Do the scan" (different context)

Both transcriptions are published to the same topic, creating ambiguity.

### 3.3 Command Acknowledgment Mismatch

The conversation agent often returns different command acknowledgments than what the command agent extracted, confusing users about what the robot will actually do.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements
1. **Context Synchronization**: Agents should have consistent understanding of conversation history
2. **Authoritative Transcription**: Single source of truth for what the user said
3. **Standalone Operation**: Each agent must work independently without waiting for siblings
4. **Bridge Simplicity**: Bridge must remain a pure relay without business logic
5. **Proxyless Operation**: Agents must function correctly with or without the reflection proxy

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Low Latency**: Context sharing should not add significant latency
2. **Scalability**: Solution should support future modalities and N-agent scenarios
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between bridge and agents
4. **Compatibility**: Preserve ability to swap bridge implementation

## 5. Options Considered

### Option A: Dedicated Transcription Agent
- **Approach**: One agent does all transcription, others consume
- **Pros**: Single source of truth, no divergence
- **Cons**: Adds latency, single point of failure
- **Rejected**: Too much architectural change, latency penalty

### Option B: Leader Election
- **Approach**: First agent to transcribe "wins"
- **Pros**: No dedicated agent needed
- **Cons**: Race conditions, complex coordination
- **Rejected**: Complexity without clear benefit

### Option C: Transcription Reconciliation
- **Approach**: Bridge or coordinator reconciles different transcriptions
- **Pros**: Could provide best transcription
- **Cons**: Complex, adds latency, violates bridge simplicity requirement
- **Rejected**: Adds business logic to bridge

### Option D: Accept Divergence with Tagging
- **Approach**: Tag all messages with agent ID, accept multiple versions
- **Pros**: Honest about divergence, simple
- **Cons**: Doesn't solve the problem, just makes it visible
- **Rejected**: Doesn't improve user experience

### Option E: Conversation Agent as Authority
- **Approach**: Conversation agent's transcription is authoritative for context
- **Pros**:
  - Leverages better context for accuracy
  - Natural authority (primary user interface)
  - Simple implementation
  - No latency for commands
- **Cons**: Requires agent awareness of siblings
- **Status**: Original selection, but requires bridge modification

### Option F: WebSocket Reflection Proxy (SELECTED)
- **Approach**: Lightweight proxy between agents and bridge handles reflection
- **Pros**:
  - Bridge-agnostic (works with any WebSocket bridge)
  - Transparent to agents (configuration-only change)
  - Preserves metadata in reflection path
  - Optional component (can be bypassed)
  - Clean separation of concerns
- **Cons**: Additional process to manage
- **Selected**: Enables Option E without bridge lock-in

## 5.1 Bridge Reflection Analysis

### Critical Discovery
Investigation of standard WebSocket bridges (rosbridge_suite, Foxglove Bridge, RWS) revealed:
- **No ros-external to ros-external reflection**: All bridges assume messages from WebSocket clients go to ROS, not to other WebSocket clients
- **No automatic ROS reflection**: Published messages don't automatically return to the bridge
- **Missing communication path**: Without modification, agents cannot receive each other's messages

### Implications
- Pure ROS round-trip requires either:
  - Bridge subscribing to its own published topics (creates loops)
  - Separate ROS reflector node (architecturally complex)
  - Bridge modification (locks to custom implementation)
- Standard bridges cannot support cross-agent communication without additional components

## 6. Proposed Solution

The solution combines agent sibling awareness (Option E) with a WebSocket reflection proxy (Option F) to enable cross-agent communication without modifying the bridge.

### 6.1 WebSocket Reflection Proxy

A lightweight proxy sits between agents and the bridge to enable reflection:
- Single shared process listening on dedicated port (e.g., 8766)
- Agents connect to proxy instead of directly to bridge
- Proxy maintains single upstream connection to bridge
- Reflects ros-external messages to subscribing ros-external agents
- Transparent pass-through for all other messages

### 6.2 Agent Sibling Awareness

Agents become aware of their role and potential siblings:

```python
# In agent config
agent_role: "conversation"  # or "command"
sibling_agents: ["command_agent_id"]  # optional
```

### 6.3 Message Tagging

Agents tag their messages with metadata:

```python
transcript_data = {
    "data": transcript,
    "metadata": {
        "agent_id": self.agent_id,
        "agent_role": self.agent_role,
        "timestamp": time.time()
    }
}
```

Bridge remains a pure relay - just passes enriched messages through.

### 6.4 Subscription Patterns

Agents subscribe to each other's output topics:

```python
# Conversation agent subscribes to:
- prompt_voice
- response_cmd  # From command agent

# Command agent subscribes to:
- prompt_voice
- response_text  # From conversation agent
- prompt_transcript  # For authoritative transcription
```

### 6.5 Context Incorporation Logic

```python
def handle_transcript(self, envelope):
    metadata = envelope.data.get("metadata", {})
    
    # Check if this is from conversation agent (authoritative)
    if metadata.get("agent_role") == "conversation":
        # Use for context
        self.context_manager.add_turn("user", transcript)
    else:
        # Log for analysis but don't add to context
        self.logger.debug(f"Alt transcript: {transcript}")
```

### 6.6 Standalone Operation

Agents check for sibling configuration but don't require it:

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.sibling_agents = config.get("sibling_agents", [])
    self.has_siblings = len(self.sibling_agents) > 0
    
    # Subscribe to sibling topics only if configured
    if self.has_siblings:
        subscriptions.extend(self._get_sibling_subscriptions())
```

## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Prerequisites
- **Complete topic renaming** (discussed in separate planning session)
- This ensures clean topic namespace before adding cross-subscriptions

### 7.2 Phase 1: Message Tagging
- Add metadata to all agent-published messages
- Include agent_id and agent_role
- No behavior changes yet

### 7.3 Phase 2: Sibling Configuration
- Add agent_role and sibling_agents to config files
- Implement conditional subscription logic
- Still no context sharing

### 7.4 Phase 3: Cross-Subscription with Reflection Proxy
- Deploy WebSocket reflection proxy on port 8766
- Update agent configs to connect through proxy (port change only)
- Conversation agent subscribes to response_cmd
- Command agent subscribes to response_text
- Proxy handles reflection of ros-external messages
- Add filtering to prevent self-loops

### 7.5 Phase 4: Context Incorporation
- Implement authoritative transcription logic
- Add context updates from sibling outputs
- Test convergence over multiple turns
- Ensure agents gracefully handle missing cross-agent topics when running without proxy
- Log informational messages when sibling topics unavailable but continue normal operation

### 7.6 Phase 5: User Prefix Activation (Optional)
- Activate the dormant user prefix system
- Use for injecting recent cross-agent context
- Template variables from shared context

## 8. Technical Design

### 8.1 Message Format

```json
{
  "topic": "/prompt_transcript",
  "data": "move forward please",
  "metadata": {
    "agent_id": "gemini_conversational",
    "agent_role": "conversation",
    "timestamp": 1736819200.123,
    "conversation_id": "conv_abc123",
    "turn_number": 5
  }
}
```

### 8.2 Configuration Schema

```yaml
# conversation_agent.yaml
agent_config:
  agent_id: "oai_conversation"
  agent_role: "conversation"
  sibling_agents: ["oai_command"]
  
  subscriptions:
    - topic: "prompt_voice"
    - topic: "response_cmd"
      filter:
        agent_role: "command"  # Only from command agents
        
  context_sharing:
    accept_authoritative_transcripts: false  # Is authority
    provide_authoritative_transcripts: true
```

### 8.3 Fallback Mechanisms

1. **Missing Sibling**: Continue normal operation, no waiting
2. **Delayed Transcription**: Use own transcription, update on next turn
3. **Metadata Missing**: Treat as legacy message, log warning

## 9. Edge Cases

### 9.1 Command Agent Finishes First
- Publishes its transcript immediately
- ROS systems record it
- Conversation agent's authoritative version updates context later
- Commands execute without delay

### 9.2 Conversation Agent Timeout
- Command agent proceeds with its own transcription
- Context may diverge slightly
- Resynchronizes on next successful turn

### 9.3 Solo Agent Deployment
- Agent detects no siblings configured
- Operates normally without cross-subscriptions
- No performance impact

## 10. Testing Strategy

### 10.1 Unit Tests
- Message tagging validation
- Metadata parsing
- Sibling detection logic

### 10.2 Integration Tests
- Dual agent context convergence
- Transcription authority selection
- Solo agent operation

### 10.3 System Tests
- Multi-turn conversations with context references
- Command extraction consistency
- Latency measurements

## 11. Success Metrics

1. **Context Convergence**: Agents have consistent context within 2 turns
2. **Transcription Consistency**: 95% agreement on transcriptions
3. **Command Alignment**: Conversation acknowledgments match extracted commands
4. **Latency Impact**: < 50ms additional latency for context sharing
5. **Standalone Success**: 100% functionality when deployed solo

## 12. Future Enhancements

### 12.1 Multi-Modal Agents
- Vision agents sharing scene descriptions
- Gesture recognition agents sharing interpretations
- Emotion detection agents sharing sentiment

### 12.2 Dynamic Authority
- Authority changes based on context type
- Vision agent authoritative for "what do you see"
- Command agent authoritative for robot state

### 12.3 Context Summarization
- Intelligent summarization for long conversations
- Selective context based on relevance
- Token optimization for LLM calls

## 13. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Message loops | High | Agent-side filtering, never subscribe to own outputs |
| Increased complexity | Medium | Phased rollout, extensive testing |
| Bridge coupling | Low | Use reflection proxy instead of modifying bridge |
| Version skew | Medium | Graceful handling of missing metadata |
| Proxy failure | High | Optional bypass mode, health monitoring, auto-restart |
| Reflection latency | Low | Local process, typically <1ms overhead |

## 14. Decision Log

1. **Bridge remains pure relay**: Preserves swapability with other ROS bridges
2. **Reflection proxy for cross-agent communication**: Enables sibling awareness without bridge lock-in
3. **Conversation agent as authority**: Best context leads to best transcriptions
4. **Sibling awareness over coordination**: Simple, no synchronization required
5. **Eventual consistency over perfect sync**: Accepts some divergence for low latency

## 15. Reflection Proxy Technical Design

### 15.1 Architecture
Single shared process that intercepts WebSocket connections:
```
Agents â†’ Reflection Proxy (8766) â†’ Bridge (8765) â†’ ROS
           â†‘                â†“
           â””â”€â”€ Reflection â”€â”€â”˜
```

### 15.2 Port Configuration
- Reflection Proxy: Port 8766 (accepts all agent connections)
- ROS Bridge: Port 8765 (proxy connects as single client)
- Agents require only configuration change (port 8765 â†’ 8766)

### 15.3 Key Features
- **Transparent**: Agents unaware of proxy existence
- **Selective Reflection**: Only reflects messages matching sibling subscriptions
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains agent metadata in reflected messages
- **Optional Bypass**: Can be disabled via configuration - agents connect directly to bridge at port 8765
- **Bridge Agnostic**: Works with any WebSocket bridge implementation
- **Single Upstream Connection**: Bridge sees only one client (the proxy), reducing bridge load
- **Topic Agnostic**: No hardcoded topic names - learns from agent registrations
- **Future Proof**: New topics automatically supported without proxy modifications
- **Backward Compatible**: Agents function correctly with direct bridge connection (no proxy)

### 15.4 Connection Architecture
From the bridge's perspective:
- Sees only 1 WebSocket connection (from proxy, not N agents)
- Receives 1 combined registration with all agent subscriptions
- Sends each ROS message only once (proxy handles distribution)
- Completely unaware multiple agents exist

From each agent's perspective:
- Connects normally to what it thinks is the bridge
- Sends standard registration and messages
- Receives both ROS-originating and sibling-reflected messages
- Completely unaware proxy exists

### 15.5 Dynamic Topic Handling
The proxy is completely content-agnostic:
```
When agent registers â†’ Proxy tracks: agent_id â†” [subscribed_topics]
When agent publishes â†’ Proxy checks: who subscribes to this topic?
When ROS publishes â†’ Proxy forks: to all agents subscribing to topic
```

Adding new topics requires ZERO proxy changes:
- Agent subscribes to `new_fancy_topic` â†’ Proxy automatically tracks it
- Another agent publishes to `new_fancy_topic` â†’ Proxy automatically reflects it
- Bridge publishes `new_fancy_topic` from ROS â†’ Proxy automatically forks it

### 15.6 Message Flow
1. Agent publishes message with metadata
2. Proxy checks if other agents subscribe to that topic
3. If match found: Reflect as `inbound_message` to subscribers
4. Always forward original to bridge for ROS publishing
5. Bridge messages pass through unchanged

### 15.7 Example Flow
```
Agent1 registers: subscribes to ["prompt_voice", "response_cmd"]
Agent2 registers: subscribes to ["prompt_voice", "response_text"]

Proxy â†’ Bridge: subscribes to ["prompt_voice", "response_cmd", "response_text"]

ROS publishes "prompt_voice" â†’ Bridge â†’ Proxy â†’ Fork to Agent1 AND Agent2
Agent1 publishes "response_text" â†’ Proxy â†’ Reflect to Agent2 + Forward to Bridge
Agent2 publishes "response_cmd" â†’ Proxy â†’ Reflect to Agent1 + Forward to Bridge
```

### 15.8 Downsides and Mitigations
| Downside | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Additional process | Medium | Health monitoring, auto-restart |
| Single point of failure | High | Optional bypass mode |
| Added latency | Low | Typically <1ms on localhost |
| Message ordering | Low | Timestamp-based ordering in agents |
| Connection overhead | Low | Single upstream connection to bridge |

## 16. Backward Compatibility and Configuration

### 16.1 Dual Configuration Strategy
To maintain full backward compatibility:
- **Original configs** (port 8765): Direct bridge connection for standard operation
- **Proxy configs** (port 8766): Proxy connection for cross-agent communication
- Agent code remains unchanged - only configuration determines connection mode

### 16.2 Launch File Options
- `oai_dual_agent.launch.py`: Direct bridge connection (original behavior)
- `oai_dual_agent_with_proxy.launch.py`: Proxy-enabled for context sharing
- `gemini_dual_agent.launch.py`: Direct bridge connection (original behavior)
- `gemini_dual_agent_with_proxy.launch.py`: Proxy-enabled for context sharing

### 16.3 Graceful Degradation
When running without proxy (Phase 4):
- Agents attempt to subscribe to cross-agent topics
- Missing topics logged as INFO (not ERROR)
- Agents continue with independent context
- No functionality lost, only shared context unavailable

## 17. Conclusion

This enhancement addresses the fundamental context divergence problem in dual-agent deployments while maintaining system simplicity and performance. By making agents aware of their siblings without requiring tight coupling, we achieve better consistency without sacrificing the ability to run agents independently.

The phased implementation plan allows for gradual rollout with validation at each step, minimizing risk while delivering incremental value.
