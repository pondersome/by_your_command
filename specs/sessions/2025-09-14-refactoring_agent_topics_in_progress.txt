        91 +  ### 3.4 Prompt Expansion Utility
        92 +  
        93 +  A command-line utility (`expand_prompt`) was created to help debug and compare prompt configurations:
        94 +  
        95 +  #### Purpose
        96 +  - Expand prompts.yaml macros recursively (similar to xacro for ROS)
        97 +  - Compare different prompt variations with different macro substitutions
        98 +  - Debug complex prompt hierarchies and macro dependencies
        99 +  
       100 +  #### Usage
       101 +  ```bash
       102 +  # List all available prompts
       103 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt --list
       104 +  
       105 +  # Expand a specific prompt
       106 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt visual_analyzer
       107 +  
       108 +  # Save expanded prompt to file
       109 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt command_extractor -o expanded.txt
       110 +  
       111 +  # Add comments showing macro expansions
       112 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt conversational_assistant --comment
       113 +  
       114 +  # Control indentation (default: 2 spaces)
       115 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt visual_analyzer --indent 4
       116 +  ```
       117 +  
       118 +  #### Implementation Details
       119 +  - Located in `scripts/expand_prompt.py`
       120 +  - Handles recursive {{macro_name}} expansion
       121 +  - Supports both string and dict-style prompts
       122 +  - Prevents infinite recursion with visited set tracking
       123 +  - Integrated into CMake build system (not Python setup.py)
       124 +  
       125    #### Future Enhancement: Audio Buffering at Utterance Start
       126    To completely eliminate any remaining race conditions, an optional audio buffering mechanism was designed but not yet implemented:

       102 +  ### Prompt Expansion Utility
       103 +  Debug and compare prompt configurations using the `expand_prompt` command-line tool:
       104 +  
       105 +  ```bash
       106 +  # List all available prompts
       107 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt --list
       108 +  
       109 +  # Expand a specific prompt to see the final result
       110 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt visual_analyzer
       111 +  
       112 +  # Save expanded prompt to file for comparison
       113 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt command_extractor -o expanded.txt
       114 +  
       115 +  # Show macro expansion comments inline
       116 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt conversational_assistant --comment
       117 +  
       118 +  # Customize indentation (default: 2 spaces)
       119 +  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt visual_analyzer --indent 4
       120 +  ```
       121 +  
       122 +  This utility helps with:
       123 +  - Debugging complex prompt hierarchies
       124 +  - Comparing different macro substitutions
       125 +  - Understanding the final prompt sent to LLMs
       126 +  - Testing prompt variations quickly
       127 +  
       128    ### API Keys
       129    Set your API keys as environment variables:
       130    ```bash

● Documentation updated with the prompt expansion utility details in both files.

> shouldn't really have added to the pipecat version of gemini since that dead-ended. should have gone into the direct version.

● You're absolutely right. The prompt expansion utility should be documented in the actual implementation section, not in the Pipecat section which was never implemented. Let me fix
  that.

● Update(specs/gemini_live_pipecat_prd.md)
  ⎿  Updated specs/gemini_live_pipecat_prd.md with 34 removals

  ⎿  Updated specs/gemini_live_pipecat_prd.md with 6 additions                          
       149       - Supports recursive macro expansion
       150       - Separate prompts for conversation and command agents
       151       - Native Gemini visual descriptor macros
       152 +     - **Prompt Expansion Utility** (`scripts/expand_prompt.py`):
       153 +       - Command-line tool for debugging prompt configurations
       154 +       - Expands prompts.yaml macros recursively (similar to xacro)
       155 +       - Usage: `ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt <prompt_id>`

       157 +       - Helps compare different prompt variations with macro substitutions
       158    
       159    4. **Frame Forwarding**: Smart image frame delivery
       160       - Caches frames at bridge level

● Fixed - moved the prompt expansion utility documentation to the actual implementation section (3.5) rather than having it as a separate section after the Smart Frame Forwarding
  solution.

> you updated the pipecat prd again - we need to update @src/by_your_command/specs/gemini_live_direct_prd.md

       169    #### ROS AI Bridge Integration

● Updated the correct PRD with the prompt expansion utility documentation.

> i thought i saw an automatic search for prompts.yaml in the config folder of the package, but it doesn't seem to be working:
  ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt --list
  Error: Could not find prompts.yaml. Please specify path with -p
  [ros2run]: Process exited with failure 1

● Let me check the expand_prompt script to see how it's searching for the prompts.yaml file.

  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(scripts/expand_prompt.py)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see the issue. The script is trying to find the prompts.yaml file relative to the script location, but when installed via CMake, the script is in a different location than
  expected. Let me check where the script is actually installed and fix the path resolution.

● Bash(which expand_prompt 2>/dev/null || ros2 run --prefix "which" by_your_command expand_prompt 2>/dev/null || echo "Not found in PATH")
  ⎿  /home/karim/ros2_ws/install/by_your_command/lib/by_your_command/expand_prompt

    prompts.yaml


● Good! The prompts.yaml file is installed in the share directory. Now I need to update the script to use the ROS2 package share directory to find the file.

● Update(scripts/expand_prompt.py)
  ⎿  Updated scripts/expand_prompt.py with 25 additions and 4 removals                          
       53            if prompts_file and os.path.exists(prompts_file):

       55            else:
       56 -              # Try to find it relative to script location
       56 +              # Try multiple locations
       57 +              possible_paths = []
       58 +

       60 +              try:
       61 +                  from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
       62 +                  package_share = get_package_share_directory('by_your_command')
       63 +                  share_config_path = Path(package_share) / "config" / "prompts.yaml"

       65 +              except:
       66 +                  pass
       67 +              
       68 +              # 2. Check relative to script in source tree
       69                script_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent
       70 -              config_path = script_dir / "config" / "prompts.yaml"
       71 -              if config_path.exists():
       72 -                  self.prompts_file = str(config_path)
       70 +              source_config_path = script_dir / "config" / "prompts.yaml"
       71 +              possible_paths.append(source_config_path)
       72 +              
       73 +              # 3. Check current working directory
       74 +              cwd_config_path = Path.cwd() / "config" / "prompts.yaml"
       75 +              possible_paths.append(cwd_config_path)
       76 +              
       77 +              # Try each path
       78 +              for path in possible_paths:
       79 +                  if path.exists():
       80 +                      self.prompts_file = str(path)
       81 +                      break
       82                else:
       83                    raise FileNotFoundError(
       84                        "Could not find prompts.yaml. Please specify path with -p"

● Now let's rebuild the package and test if it works:

● Bash(colcon build --packages-select by_your_command --symlink-install)
  ⎿  Starting >>> by_your_command        
     Finished <<< by_your_command [8.37s]

● Bash(source /home/karim/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash && ros2 run by_your_command expand_prompt --list)
  ⎿  Available macros:

     … +20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Excellent! The script now works correctly and finds the prompts.yaml file using the ROS2 package share directory. The fix successfully allows the expand_prompt utility to locate
  the configuration file when run as a ROS2 command.

> investigate how we are using the prompt loader - are we assembling the sytem prompt on each session creation, or on each turn? when are we building the user prompt? are they handled 
  differently?

● I'll investigate how the prompt loader is being used across the codebase, focusing on when and how system and user prompts are assembled.

● Analysis Complete: Prompt Loading and Assembly Patterns

  Based on my investigation, here's how the prompt system works:

  System Prompt Assembly

  1. When Assembled: System prompts are assembled once per session creation, not per turn
    - During connect_session() → _configure_session() in both OpenAI and Gemini agents
    - This happens when establishing a new WebSocket connection or cycling sessions
  2. Assembly Process:
    - PromptLoader loads prompts.yaml at startup
    - Macros are expanded at load time (in _load_prompts())
    - When session is created:
        - Agent gets prompt by ID or uses selection rules
      - ContextManager.build_system_prompt() adds conversation context if available
      - Final prompt is sent as part of session configuration
  3. Key Code Locations:
    - OpenAI: oai_session_manager.py:67-88 - assembled in _configure_session()
    - Gemini: gemini_session_manager.py:209-239 - assembled in _build_session_config()

  User Prompt Prefixes

  1. Current Status: NOT ACTIVELY USED in production agents
    - Defined in prompts.yaml (user_prompt_prefixes section)
    - Methods exist in PromptLoader (get_user_prefix(), build_full_prompt())
    - Only used in test files, not in actual agent code
  2. Intended Design:
    - Would prepend context to user messages
    - Supports template variables like {last_topic}, {last_command}
    - Could be used per-turn to inject context

  Key Differences

  1. System Prompts:
    - Assembled once per session
    - Include full expanded macros
    - Can have conversation context appended
    - Sent as part of session configuration
  2. User Prefixes (if used):
    - Would be assembled per turn
    - Designed for dynamic context injection
    - Currently not implemented in agents

  Implications

  - System prompts are static for the entire session duration
  - No per-turn prompt modification currently happens
  - Macro expansion happens at load time, not runtime
  - Context preservation happens through ContextManager appending to base prompt

  This architecture means that prompt changes require either:
  1. Session cycling (for system prompts)
  2. Implementation of user prefix injection (for per-turn modifications)

> ok, good to know. i consider all of this to be context management: system prompts + user prompts + dialog history. let's continue this line of inquiry - how is context history 
  injection carriered out? both on the oai side and the gemini side. this is currently the most dynamic version of context management. but right now, i think that we are not doing a 
  good job of unifying context across dual agents. i suspect that the convo agent has a different context evolution than the command agent. for example, i see the conversation agent 
  often return a different command acknowledgment than the command agent returned. over multiple turns this divergence deepens. this is partially what the user prefixes were meant to 
  accomplish - a sharing of context between multiple active agents.

● Context Management Analysis Complete

  Current Context Management Architecture

  How Context History is Tracked:

  1. OpenAI Agents:
    - Uses ContextManager to track conversation turns
    - add_conversation_turn() called when transcriptions are received (lines 666, 694 in oai_realtime_agent.py)
    - Context injected during session creation via build_system_prompt()
    - Context preserved across session cycles (for cost optimization)
  2. Gemini Agents:
    - Same ContextManager infrastructure
    - add_conversation_turn() in receive_coordinator.py (lines 339, 392)
    - Context injected identically during session creation
    - BUT: Command agents skip adding assistant turns (line 391-392)

  The Context Divergence Problem:

  Each agent maintains its own isolated context:
  - Conversation agent tracks: user input → assistant response
  - Command agent tracks: user input → (sometimes) command extraction
  - No sharing mechanism exists between agents
  - Bridge just broadcasts messages - doesn't maintain shared state

  Result: Over time, agents have different conversation histories:
  - Conversation agent might say "I'll move forward"
  - Command agent extracts "move@forward"
  - Next turn, conversation agent references "moving forward" but command agent has no context

  Why User Prefixes Were Designed (But Not Implemented):

  User prefixes were meant to inject shared context per-turn:
  user_prompt_prefixes:
    context_reminder:
      prefix: |
        Remember, we were just discussing: {last_topic}
        The user's last command was: {last_command}

  This would allow:
  - Injecting what the OTHER agent said/did
  - Keeping agents synchronized on recent activity
  - Dynamic per-turn context updates

  But currently:
  - build_full_prompt() exists but is never called
  - No mechanism to share {last_command} between agents
  - No per-turn prompt modification happens

> when you suggest these additional topics - that generally means a ros topic so the bridge has to be informed and shuttle them back to ros? this has the benefit in that most ongoing 
  logging mechanisms (like rosbag) are happening on the ros side and there is more instrumentation to take advantage of. i wonder if this might cause an additional turn of lag? if we 
  are asking the bridge to act as a defacto context cache between dual agents, does it matter which one responds first? right now we don't have a concept of explicitly synchronizing 
  the behavior of dual agents at all, much less within one turn. i suspect this is not the way to go - it could increase lag significantly if we sequenced their calls to the llm.

● You're absolutely right to question the additional ROS topics approach. Let me reconsider based on your insights:

  Context Sharing Without Additional Lag

  The Problem with ROS Topics for Context

  - Extra round-trip through bridge → ROS → bridge
  - Potential turn of lag for context synchronization
  - Sequencing/synchronization complexity between agents
  - No guarantee of ordering (who responds first?)

  Alternative: Direct Agent-to-Agent via WebSocket

  Since agents already connect to the bridge via WebSocket, they could:

  1. Subscribe to each other's existing outputs directly:
    - Command agent already publishes to /command_transcript
    - Conversation agent publishes to /llm_transcript
    - Each agent just needs to subscribe to the other's output topic
  2. Update context asynchronously:
    - No waiting or synchronization required
    - Each agent updates its context when it receives the other's output
    - Natural eventual consistency

  Simpler Implementation

  Instead of new infrastructure, just modify agent initialization:

  # In conversation agent
  subscriptions = [
      {"topic": "voice_chunks"},
      {"topic": "command_transcript"},  # Add this
      ...
  ]

  # In command agent  
  subscriptions = [
      {"topic": "voice_chunks"},
      {"topic": "llm_transcript"},  # Add this
      ...
  ]

  Then handle incoming transcripts from the other agent:

  # When receiving the other agent's transcript
  if envelope.topic_name.endswith("/command_transcript"):
      # Conversation agent adds command context
      self.context_manager.add_turn("system", f"[Command executed: {data}]")
  elif envelope.topic_name.endswith("/llm_transcript"):
      # Command agent adds conversation context
      self.context_manager.add_turn("assistant", data)

  Benefits of This Approach

  1. Zero additional latency - uses existing message flow
  2. No synchronization needed - agents remain independent
  3. Natural ordering - context updates as messages arrive
  4. Works with existing logging - no new ROS topics needed
  5. Gradual convergence - contexts align over multiple turns

  The Key Insight

  We don't need perfect synchronization within a turn. We just need each agent to know what the other agent said in previous turns. This way:
  - Turn N: Agents might have slightly different contexts
  - Turn N+1: Both agents know what both said in Turn N
  - Over time: Contexts naturally converge

  This is much simpler than trying to coordinate agents within a single turn, and avoids the latency penalty of additional ROS round-trips.

> does this create a race loop? how do agents know not to respond to a subscribe event generated because they just published something??

● Excellent catch! Yes, this could create a feedback loop. Let me think through the message flow:

  The Feedback Loop Problem

  When conversation agent publishes to /llm_transcript:
  1. Bridge broadcasts to all subscribers
  2. Command agent receives it (good)
  3. Conversation agent also receives it (bad - it's their own message!)
  4. Could trigger another response...

  How Agents Currently Avoid Self-Loops

  Looking at the code, agents already handle some similar cases:

  1. Voice chunks: Both agents receive all voice input - no issue since it's external
  2. Conversation ID: Agents receive but check if it's different from their current ID
  3. Text input: Agents process external text, not their own outputs

  But for transcripts, there's no self-filtering mechanism.

  Solutions

  Option 1: Agent ID Filtering at Bridge

  The bridge could tag messages with source agent ID and not send back to originator:
  # In broadcast_to_agents
  for agent_id, websocket in agents_copy.items():
      if envelope.source_agent_id == agent_id:
          continue  # Don't send back to source

  Option 2: Topic-Based Filtering

  Agents already specify what they publish vs subscribe:
  - Conversation agent: publishes /llm_transcript, subscribes /command_transcript
  - Command agent: publishes /command_transcript, subscribes /llm_transcript

  This works if agents NEVER subscribe to topics they publish to.

  Option 3: Message Tagging

  Add metadata to identify source:
  # When publishing
  transcript_data = {
      "data": final_transcript,
      "source_agent": self.agent_id
  }

  # When receiving
  if data.get("source_agent") == self.agent_id:
      return  # Ignore own messages

  Current Reality Check

  Let me verify - do agents currently subscribe to their own output topics?

  Looking at the registration pattern, agents specify subscriptions explicitly. The risk exists only if:
  1. An agent subscribes to a topic it also publishes to
  2. The bridge doesn't filter based on source

  The cleanest solution is Option 2 - ensure agents never subscribe to their own output topics. This requires:
  - Careful configuration
  - Clear separation of publish vs subscribe topics
  - Documentation of this constraint

  This avoids any complex filtering logic and keeps the system simple.

> option 2 has a potential weakness as we move forward with some of the other things on our todo list. for example, you are talking only about the primary response that each agent 
  sends back, but they also send back a transript of the voice prompt. i've discovered that when context diverges between dual agents enough, even when fed the same voice_chunks, the 
  dual agents can come back with different transcriptions of what was said. so now we have two potentially different voice transcripts sharing the same topic name?

● Excellent point! This reveals a deeper issue with context divergence. Let me trace through this:

  The Transcript Divergence Problem

  When context diverges significantly:
  1. User says: "Do that again"
  2. Conversation agent (knows recent context): transcribes as "Do that again"
  3. Command agent (different context): might transcribe as "Do the scan"
  4. Both publish to /user_transcript (or similar)

  Now we have:
  - Two different interpretations of the same audio
  - Published to the same topic
  - Other systems don't know which is "correct"

  This Gets Worse With More Agents

  As you scale to N agents:
  - N different transcriptions possible
  - N different contexts influencing interpretation
  - Potentially N different responses to the "same" input

  The Root Cause

  The real problem isn't the feedback loop - it's that agents are transcribing independently when they should be sharing a single source of truth for:
  1. What the user said (transcription)
  2. What happened (events/commands)
  3. What was responded (unified output)

  Potential Architectures

  Option A: Dedicated Transcription Agent

  - One agent does transcription, publishes once
  - All other agents consume that single transcription
  - But: Adds latency, single point of failure

  Option B: Leader Election

  - First agent to transcribe "wins"
  - Others use that transcription
  - But: Race conditions, complexity

  Option C: Transcription Reconciliation

  - All agents transcribe
  - Bridge or coordinator reconciles differences
  - Publishes consensus transcript
  - But: Complex, still has latency

  Option D: Accept the Divergence

  - Each agent maintains its own view
  - Tag transcripts with agent_id
  - Downstream systems choose which to trust
  - Reality: This is what happens now, just hidden

  The Uncomfortable Truth

  Context divergence is a fundamental problem with multiple independent agents. The more we try to sync them, the more we either:
  1. Add latency (waiting for consensus)
  2. Add complexity (reconciliation logic)
  3. Risk cascading inconsistencies

  Maybe the answer isn't to perfectly sync contexts, but to:
  - Minimize divergence where possible (share what we can)
  - Accept some divergence as inevitable
  - Make the system robust to inconsistencies
  - Be explicit about which agent is authoritative for what

  This suggests Option 3 (message tagging) might be the most honest approach - at least it makes the divergence visible and manageable.

> i don't want to add usage-based business logic to the bridge - it should remain a relay/bridge only. this choice preserves maximum swapability if we at some point elect to replace 
  our bridge with one of the more universal ros bridges.
  any logic about dual usage of the agents should either be placed in a new coordinator, or we can just make the agent aware it may have siblings. i'm more in favor of the latter, and 
  in fact we can make the agent code more aware of convo vs. command modalities and potentially add any other modalities as they might be discovered.
  Option E - i believe it is ok to, for now, take the conversational agent's voice transcription as the default, meaning that's the one that gets folded into ongoing conversation 
  history for both agents, because the convo agent's voice transcription should have been generated from more fulsome context when divergences still happen. there could be a timing 
  problem here, since the convo agent can take more time to complete. i'm not sure if the user voice transcript would be delayed by a long response. maybe the timing doesn't matter, 
  because the transcripts and responses are relevent for the subsequent turn.
  but we don't want to mute the voice transcription from the command agent - it should still go back to ROS for recording / analysis. since the topic names are the same, we can 
  differentiate these with tagging.
  the text responses themselves are differentiated by topic name.
  analyze these suggestions

● Your analysis is spot-on. Let me examine Option E and the implications:

  Option E Analysis: Conversational Agent as Transcription Authority

  Strengths of This Approach

  1. Context Quality: The conversation agent has richer context, leading to better transcription accuracy
    - "Do that again" vs "Do the scan" - conversation agent knows what "that" refers to
    - Better handling of pronouns, references, and context-dependent phrases
  2. Natural Authority: Conversation agent is already the "primary" interface with the user
    - It maintains the full dialogue history
    - Command agent is more of a specialized extractor
  3. Timing is Actually Fine:
    - Transcripts are used for the NEXT turn's context
    - Even if conversation agent is slower, by turn N+1 both agents have the "official" transcript
    - Command agent can still act immediately on its own interpretation

  Implementation Strategy: Agent-Aware Siblings

  # In each agent's config
  agent_role: "conversation"  # or "command"
  sibling_agents: ["command_agent_id"]  # or ["conversation_agent_id"]

  # In message handling
  if envelope.topic_name.endswith("/user_transcript"):
      if is_from_conversation_agent(envelope):
          # This is the authoritative transcription
          self.context_manager.add_turn("user", transcript)
      else:
          # Log for analysis but don't add to context
          self.logger.debug(f"Alt transcript from {source}: {transcript}")

  Message Tagging Without Bridge Logic

  Agents tag their own messages:
  # When publishing
  transcript_data = {
      "data": transcript,
      "metadata": {
          "agent_id": self.agent_id,
          "agent_role": self.agent_role,  # "conversation" or "command"
          "timestamp": time.time()
      }
  }

  Bridge remains pure relay - just passes the enriched message through.

  Handling the Edge Cases

  1. Command agent finishes first:
    - Publishes its transcript (tagged as "command")
    - ROS systems record it
    - Other agents see it but wait for authoritative version
  2. Conversation agent is much slower:
    - Command agent proceeds with its interpretation
    - Context sync happens on next turn
    - Acceptable because commands need low latency
  3. Conversation agent fails/timeouts:
    - Could fall back to command agent's transcript
    - Or proceed without transcript in context
    - System degrades gracefully

  Why This Works

  This approach acknowledges the reality that:
  - Different modalities have different requirements (latency vs accuracy)
  - Perfect synchronization isn't necessary (eventual consistency is fine)
  - Agents can be aware of their role in the ecosystem
  - Bridge stays pure (just data transport)

  Minimal Implementation Path

  1. Phase 1: Add agent role/ID tagging to messages
  2. Phase 2: Make agents subscribe to each other's outputs
  3. Phase 3: Implement "authoritative transcript" logic
  4. Phase 4: Add context incorporation from sibling agents

  This can be done incrementally without breaking existing functionality.

  The key insight: We're not trying to eliminate divergence, just managing it intelligently by designating authority based on which agent has the best information for each type of
  decision.

> i want to add another requirement as we lean into sibling awareness - we should always be able to fire up a conversation or command agent as a solo agent. they shouldn't have so much
   interdependence such that a command agent waits interminably for imput for a conversational agent that is not present in the current launch context.
  i'd like you to package up this entire discussion as a new PRD - call it context_management_enhancements_for_dual_agents.prd.md 
  include all the options we considered and the choices made. the goal is to be able to use that PRD to kick off this enhancement work - but only after we've done the topic renaming 
  that we spoke about a few days ago.

  ⎿  Plan: Create Comprehensive Context Management PRD

     I'll create a PRD that captures our entire discussion about context management, including:

     Document Contents:

     1. Executive Summary
       - Context divergence problem in dual agents
       - Solution: Sibling awareness with conversation agent as transcription authority
     2. Background - Prompt Loading Analysis (from earlier investigation)
       - System prompts assembled once per session
       - Macros expanded at load time
       - User prefixes designed but not implemented
       - Each agent maintains isolated context
     3. Current Context Management Architecture
       - How OpenAI agents track context
       - How Gemini agents track context  
       - The divergence problem over multiple turns
       - Why user prefixes were designed
     4. Problem Statement
       - Each agent has different conversation history
       - Transcription divergence when context differs
       - Command acknowledgments don't match conversation flow
     5. Requirements
       - Bridge must remain pure relay (no business logic)
       - Agents must work standalone without siblings
       - Minimize latency
       - Support future modalities
     6. Options Considered
       - Option A: Dedicated transcription agent
       - Option B: Leader election
       - Option C: Transcription reconciliation  
       - Option D: Accept divergence with tagging
       - Option E: Conversation agent as authority (CHOSEN)
     7. Proposed Solution
       - Agent sibling awareness
       - Message tagging with metadata
       - Authoritative transcription from conversation agent
       - Graceful standalone operation
     8. Implementation Design
       - Message format with agent metadata
       - Subscription patterns
       - Context incorporation logic
       - Fallback mechanisms
     9. Implementation Plan
       - Phase 1: Add agent role/ID tagging
       - Phase 2: Cross-subscription between agents
       - Phase 3: Authoritative transcript logic
       - Phase 4: Context incorporation
       - Dependency: Complete topic renaming first
     10. Edge Cases & Fallbacks
       - Command agent finishes first
       - Conversation agent timeout
       - Solo agent operation

     The PRD will be comprehensive enough to guide implementation while documenting why each decision was made.

     # Context Management Enhancements for Dual Agents - PRD
     **Created:** 2025-09-14
     **Status:** Draft
     **Author:** Karim Virani
     **Scope:** Enhanced context synchronization between conversation and command agents
     ## 1. Executive Summary
     This document outlines enhancements to address context divergence between dual agents (conversation and command extraction) in the by_your_command system. The core problem is
     that each agent maintains isolated conversation context, leading to inconsistent responses and transcriptions over time.
     … +363 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● PRD created successfully at /home/karim/ros2_ws/src/by_your_command/specs/context_management_enhancements_for_dual_agents_prd.md. The document comprehensively captures:

  1. Our investigation into prompt loading and context management
  2. The context divergence problem between agents
  3. All options we considered (A through E)
  4. The chosen solution (Option E with sibling awareness)
  5. Implementation plan with prerequisite of topic renaming
  6. Technical design maintaining bridge as pure relay
  7. Edge cases and fallback mechanisms

  The PRD is ready to guide implementation after the topic renaming work is complete.

> let's return to our conversation about renaming agent generatated topics for better clarity throughout the system. do you remember that discussion or do you need a refresher?

● I remember we discussed renaming agent-generated topics for better clarity, but let me search for the specific details of that conversation to ensure I have the complete context.

● Search(pattern: "topic.*rename|rename.*topic|llm_transcript|command_transcript", path: "specs")
  ⎿  Found 35 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● I can see references to the topics in the specs, but I don't have the specific conversation about renaming them in my immediate context. Let me check what the current topic names
  are and what clarity issues might exist:

● Search(pattern: "llm_transcript|command_transcript|user_transcript|audio_out", path: "~/ros2_ws/src/by_your_command", glob: "*.yaml", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 23 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Based on what I can see, the current topic naming could indeed use clarification. The issues I observe:

  Current Topic Names and Their Ambiguities:

  1. llm_transcript - Unclear which direction (user input or assistant output?)
  2. command_transcript - Mixed purpose (commands AND scene descriptions)
  3. audio_out - Generic, doesn't indicate it's from the assistant
  4. No user_transcript topic - User transcriptions seem to go somewhere else?

  Potential Clarity Issues:

  - Direction ambiguity: Is llm_transcript what the user said TO the LLM or what the LLM said?
  - Agent ambiguity: Which agent generated this transcript?
  - Content ambiguity: command_transcript contains both commands and visual scene data

  Would you like to refresh me on the specific renaming scheme you had in mind? Or shall I propose a clearer naming convention based on the issues I see?

  Some initial thoughts for clearer names:
  - assistant_audio instead of audio_out
  - assistant_transcript instead of llm_transcript
  - user_transcript for user's speech
  - extracted_commands instead of command_transcript
  - scene_description for visual analysis

  But I'd prefer to understand your original vision for the renaming before proposing changes.

> this was conversation that come up while reviewing the diagrams we build for explaining prompt construction and usage. take a look 
  @src/by_your_command/specs/sessions/2025-09-09-trynafix-gemini.txt and read from line 2898 through 3072. this might be a bit confusing because we were discussing both the 
  topic/message renaming as well is debugging the gemini command agent prompts. so pay more attention to the topic or message renaming parts of that discussion. in the end the most 
  important thing to come away with is:

  give me a summary of what you learn. this will have ripple effects throughout the system. it will change both oai and gemini agents, system configuration, all relevant launch files, 
  system documentation and prds, the architecture diagrams, the bridge, many of the ros nodes, and many test scripts. we'll need to search for each of the old topic names throughout 
  the package to make sure we find and understand all occurrences. we need to be sure to maintain namespacing and prefix flexibility as we do so.

● Summary of Topic Renaming Requirements

  Based on the discussion from the session file, here's what I learned:

  Core Renaming Scheme

  The fundamental change is to use clearer, directional naming that distinguishes prompts (user input) from responses (agent output):

  | Current Name       | New Name          | Purpose                                                    |

  | llm_transcript     | response_text     | Agent text response (both conversational & command agents) |

  | NEW                | prompt_transcript | STT of user voice (currently NOT published!)               |

  Key Insights from the Discussion

  1. Terminology Confusion: The word "transcript" was overused - it should specifically mean the STT (speech-to-text) of voice input
  2. Missing Topic: User voice transcripts are logged but never published back to ROS
  3. Agent Type Clarity: The new naming makes it clear what's from the user (prompt_*) vs what's from agents (response_*)
  4. Command Format: Commands should be plain text (e.g., ARM:lookup, pan@left, bumper@right), not JSON

  Critical Requirements

  1. Maintain Namespacing: All topic references must preserve namespace and prefix flexibility
  2. Comprehensive Update: This affects:
    - Both OpenAI and Gemini agents
    - Configuration files (YAML)
    - Launch files
    - Bridge implementation
    - ROS nodes that subscribe/publish these topics
    - Test scripts
    - Documentation and PRDs
    - Architecture diagrams
  3. Add Missing Functionality: Need to actually publish prompt_transcript when user speaks

  Implementation Scope

  This is a system-wide refactoring that will touch:
  - Agent code (publishing/subscribing logic)
  - Configuration files (topic names in YAML)
  - Bridge (topic routing and registration)
  - Launch files (parameter passing)
  - Test scripts (topic references)
  - Documentation (all references to old names)

  The change improves clarity by establishing a clear convention:
  - prompt_* = input from user
  - response_* = output from agents
  - Clear modality indicators: voice, text, cmd, transcript

> are we missing anything from this plan of action?

● Let me check for additional considerations we might be missing from the topic renaming plan:

● Search(pattern: "audio_out|llm_transcript|command_transcript|voice_chunks|text_input", path: "~/ros2_ws/src/by_your_command", glob: "*.py", head_limit: 20)
  ⎿  Found 20 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "subscribe.*audio_out|subscribe.*llm_transcript|subscribe.*command_transcript", path: "~/ros2_ws/src/by_your_command", glob: "*.py", output_mode: "content",

  ⎿  Found 10 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Additional Considerations for the Topic Renaming Plan

  After further investigation, here are some additional items we should consider:

  1. Other Topics Not Yet Discussed

  - /conversation_id - Should this become /session_id or /context_id for clarity?
  - /audio_out_stamped - Used by audio_data_to_stamped.py, should become /response_voice_stamped
  - /interruption_signal - Already clear, probably keep as-is
  - /voice_active - VAD control signal, keep as-is

  2. Hard-coded Default Values

  Several nodes have hard-coded default topic names that need updating:
  - simple_audio_player.py: Default topic /audio_out → /response_voice
  - audio_data_to_stamped.py: Input /audio_out → /response_voice
  - voice_chunk_recorder.py: Input topic /audio_out → /response_voice

  3. Testing Infrastructure

  - Test scripts in /tests/ directory reference old topic names
  - Debug scripts may have hard-coded topic names
  - Test launch configurations need updates

  4. Documentation Updates

  - README files with usage examples
  - Code comments referencing old topic names
  - Any API documentation or integration guides
  - The CLAUDE.md guidance file

  5. Backward Compatibility Considerations

  Should we:
  - Add a migration period with topic aliasing?
  - Create a compatibility shim that publishes to both old and new names temporarily?
  - Or make a clean break with clear migration instructions?

  6. Topic Discovery Patterns

  Some code might use pattern matching to discover topics:
  - Anything looking for topics ending in _transcript
  - Anything looking for topics containing audio

  7. ROS Bag Files and Recordings

  - Existing rosbag recordings will have old topic names
  - Need a migration script or playback remapping strategy?

  8. External Integrations

  - Any external tools or scripts that subscribe to these topics
  - Dashboard or monitoring tools
  - Log analysis scripts

  9. Error Messages and Logging

  - Update any error messages that reference old topic names
  - Update log messages for clarity

  10. Configuration Validation

  - Add validation to ensure old topic names aren't accidentally used
  - Perhaps add warnings if old names are detected

  Are we missing anything else? The plan seems comprehensive, but we should also consider:
  - The order of implementation (which components to update first)
  - How to test the changes incrementally
  - Whether to create a feature branch for this work
  - If we need any temporary backwards compatibility layer

> some good catches there! i agree with also handling audio_out_stamped. i also agree with creating an incremental test plan and creating a feature branch for this work. but we also 
  have some uncommitted changes to deal with first, so there is a bit of a meta plan to deal with. i'd like to start by creating a PRD for this topic refactoring. this will help 
  preserve context if this work ends up extending across multiple compact cycles. then i'd like to create a commit message for the uncommitted package changes, export, compact, reload 
  the context from the prd and then begin the refactoring.

●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Plan: Create Topic Renaming PRD and Generate Commit Message

     Step 1: Create Topic Renaming PRD

     I'll create a comprehensive PRD at /home/karim/ros2_ws/src/by_your_command/specs/topic_renaming_refactoring_prd.md that includes:
     - Meta-plan for handling the refactoring across compact cycles
     - Complete topic renaming scheme
     - All affected components and files
     - Implementation phases
     - Testing strategy
     - Migration considerations

     Step 2: Generate Commit Message

     I'll review the uncommitted changes and create a commit message for:
     - Context management enhancements PRD
     - Prompt expansion utility
     - Updates to expand_prompt script
     - Documentation updates

     This will prepare everything for your commit, export, and compact operations.

     # Topic Renaming Refactoring - PRD
     **Created:** 2025-09-14
     **Status:** Draft
     **Author:** Karim Virani
     **Scope:** System-wide refactoring of ROS topic names for clarity and consistency
     ## 1. Executive Summary
     This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring of topic names throughout the by_your_command system to improve clarity and consistency. The core change is adopting a
     directional naming convention that clearly distinguishes user inputs (prompt_*) from agent outputs (response_*), while also addressing terminology confusion around the overuse 
     of "transcript."

● Commit Message

  Here's the suggested commit message for the uncommitted changes:

  feat: Add prompt expansion utility and context management documentation

  - Add expand_prompt utility for debugging prompt macros
    - Command-line tool to expand prompts.yaml macros recursively
    - Supports output to file, inline comments, and custom indentation
    - Integrated into CMake build system as ros2 command
    - Automatically finds prompts.yaml in ROS2 package share directory

  - Document context management enhancements for dual agents
    - PRD addressing context divergence between conversation and command agents
    - Proposes sibling awareness with conversation agent as transcription authority
    - Maintains bridge as pure relay without business logic
    - Enables standalone agent operation

  - Document topic renaming refactoring plan  
    - PRD for system-wide topic naming improvements
    - Changes from ambiguous names to clear prompt_*/response_* convention
    - Includes meta-plan for work spanning multiple sessions
    - Comprehensive implementation phases and testing strategy

  - Update documentation with prompt expansion utility usage
    - Add utility description to README.md
    - Update Gemini PRD with tool reference

  - Remove incorrect setup.py
    - Package is CMake-based, not Python setuptools
    - Prevents future confusion about build system

  The prompt expansion utility helps debug complex prompt hierarchies and
  compare macro expansions. The context management PRD addresses the issue
  where dual agents develop divergent conversation histories over time.
  The topic renaming PRD prepares for improving clarity of message flow
  throughout the system.

  You can now:
  1. Execute the commit with this message
  2. Export the conversation
  3. Compact to reduce context
  4. Reload with the topic renaming PRD as primary context to begin the refactoring work

> i've committed, but decide to defer the export, compact and reload until the context starts running low. you can proceed with Phase 3.

● Let's begin with Phase 1: Core Agent Changes. First, let me create a feature branch for this work:

● Bash(git checkout -b feature/topic-renaming)
  ⎿  Switched to a new branch 'feature/topic-renaming'

● Now let's start with updating the OpenAI agent to use the new topic names and add prompt_transcript publishing:

● Read(agents/oai_realtime/oai_realtime_agent.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check where the topic names are defined and used:

● Search(pattern: "published_topics\[|self\.published_topics|audio_out_topic|transcript_topic", path: "agents/oai_realtime/oai_realtime_agent.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 41 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me update the OpenAI agent with the new topic names and add prompt_transcript publishing:

● Good! Now let's move to Phase 2 and update the configuration files. Let me start with the OpenAI agent configs:

● Update(config/oai_realtime_agent.yaml)
  ⎿  File must be read first

● Read(config/oai_realtime_agent.yaml)
  ⎿  Read 83 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see the config doesn't have the audio_out_topic configuration - it's in the bridge config. Let me update the bridge configuration sections:

● Update(config/oai_realtime_agent.yaml)
  ⎿  Updated config/oai_realtime_agent.yaml with 6 additions and 4 removals

● Summary of Completed Work

  I've successfully completed Phase 1 (Core Agent Changes) and Phase 2 (Configuration Updates) of the topic renaming refactoring:

  Changes Made:

  1. Core Agent Updates (Phase 1):

  - OpenAI Agent: Updated to use new topic names and now publishes prompt_transcript
  - Gemini Agent: Updated published_topics dictionary with agent-aware topic selection
  - Gemini Receive Coordinator: Updated to publish user transcripts and use new topic names

  2. Configuration Updates (Phase 2):

  - Updated all agent configs (OpenAI and Gemini)
  - Updated all bridge configs
  - Replaced old topic names with new naming convention

  3. New Topic Naming Convention:

  | Old Name           | New Name          | Purpose                         |
  |--------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
  | voice_chunks       | prompt_voice      | User voice input                |
  | text_input         | prompt_text       | User text input                 |
  | audio_out          | response_voice    | Agent audio output              |
  | llm_transcript     | response_text     | Agent text response             |
  | command_transcript | response_cmd      | Command extraction output       |
  | NEW                | prompt_transcript | User voice STT (now published!) |

  4. Testing:

  Created and ran a comprehensive test script that verifies all changes are correct.

  Suggested Commit Message:

  feat: Implement Phase 1-2 of topic renaming refactoring

  Core agent and configuration updates for clearer topic naming convention:
  - Renamed topics to use prompt_*/response_* pattern for clarity
  - Added missing prompt_transcript publishing for user voice STT
  - Updated OpenAI and Gemini agents with new topic names
  - Updated all configuration files (agents and bridges)
  - Added test script to verify all changes

  Topic renaming:
  - voice_chunks → prompt_voice (user voice input)
  - text_input → prompt_text (user text input)  
  - audio_out → response_voice (agent audio)
  - llm_transcript → response_text (agent text)
  - command_transcript → response_cmd (commands)
  - NEW: prompt_transcript (user voice transcript)

  This improves system clarity by clearly distinguishing user inputs
  (prompt_*) from agent outputs (response_*) and addresses the
  overuse of "transcript" terminology.

  Tested with test_topic_renaming.py - all changes verified.

  You can commit these changes, and then we can continue with Phase 3 (Bridge and Infrastructure) when ready.

> i added this to the commit message: Not yet testable by running actual launch files.
  the commit has been executed. proceed.

● Now let's proceed with Phase 3: Bridge and Infrastructure. Let me examine the ROS AI bridge to update the topic handling:

● Search(pattern: "voice_chunks|text_input|audio_out|llm_transcript|command_transcript", path: "ros_ai_bridge/ros_ai_bridge.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 17 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The bridge has some references to the old topic names, particularly in the smart frame forwarding logic. Let me update those:

● Update(ros_ai_bridge/ros_ai_bridge.py)
  ⎿  Updated ros_ai_bridge/ros_ai_bridge.py with 2 additions and 1 removal                                             
       1085                    trigger_on_text = self._config.get('frame_forwarding', {}).get('trigger_on_text', True)
       1086                    continuous_nth = self._config.get('frame_forwarding', {}).get('continuous_nth_frame', 5)
       1087

       1089 +                  if trigger_on_voice and ('prompt_voice' in topic_name or 'voice_chunks' in topic_name):
       1090                        # Check if this is the first chunk (chunk_sequence == 0)
       1091                        try:
       1092                            if hasattr(msg, 'chunk_sequence'):

● Update(ros_ai_bridge/ros_ai_bridge.py)
  ⎿  Updated ros_ai_bridge/ros_ai_bridge.py with 2 additions and 1 removal                                          
       1109                            self.log_debug(f"Error checking chunk_sequence: {e}")
       1110                            is_trigger = True  # Default to triggering on error
       1111                            
       1112 -                  elif trigger_on_text and 'text_input' in topic_name:
       1112 +                  # Check for text trigger (support both old and new names for compatibility)
       1113 +                  elif trigger_on_text and ('prompt_text' in topic_name or 'text_input' in topic_name):
       1114                        is_trigger = True
       1115                        self.log_info(f"🎯 Text input detected - forwarding cached frames")
       1116                

● Now let's check if there are any other hardcoded references in the bridge:

● Search(pattern: "audio_out.*->|llm_transcript.*->|command_transcript.*->", path: "ros_ai_bridge/ros_ai_bridge.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● That's just a comment, which is fine. The bridge changes are minimal since it mostly works with topic names from configuration. Now let's move to Phase 4: Audio Components:

  feat: Complete Phases 3-5 of topic renaming refactoring

  Bridge, audio components, and launch file updates:

  Phase 3 - Bridge and Infrastructure:
  - Update ROS AI bridge frame forwarding triggers
  - Support both old and new topic names for compatibility

  Phase 4 - Audio Components:
  - Update default topics in audio nodes (simple_audio_player, etc)
  - Update silero_vad_node to publish prompt_voice
  - Update command_processor to listen for response_cmd
  - Update voice_chunk_recorder default input topic

  Phase 5 - Launch Files:
